# Power-Bi-BA-Flight-Analysis

## ✈️ Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of over **10,000 flight records** from the British Airways 2025 Summer Schedule. The primary objective was to transform raw operational data into a strategic tool for staffing optimization, fleet management, and premium service monitoring.

By replacing manual spreadsheets with an interactive dashboard, this analysis identifies peak demand periods and high-value customer volumes to drive better operational decisions.

## 📊 Operational Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* **Flight Volume:** Managed over 10,000 individual flights during the summer season.
* **Global Capacity:** Handled a total volume of **2 Million+ seats** across the network.
* **VIP Loyalty:** Tracked **15,000+ Gold Members** and **80,000 Silver Members** to ensure premium service standards at check-in and lounges.
* **Service Mix:** Visualized the capacity split between Economy, Business, and First Class.

## 🛠️ Data Preparation & Refinement
To ensure the data was "dashboard-ready," the following steps were taken:
* **Data Scaling:** Processed 10,000 rows, expanding the dataset from 23 to 28 columns for deeper insights.
* **Cleaning:** Renamed technical system headers (e.g., `AIRCRAFT_NAME`) to user-friendly labels like `Aircraft Model`.
* **Feature Engineering:** Created a **'Total Seats'** calculation to measure the combined volume across all cabin classes for every flight.
